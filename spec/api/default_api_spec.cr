  # @option opts [String] :send_digits A string of keys to dial after connecting to the number, maximum of 32 digits. Valid digits in the string include: any digit (&#x60;0&#x60;-&#x60;9&#x60;), &#39;&#x60;#&#x60;&#39;, &#39;&#x60;*&#x60;&#39; and &#39;&#x60;w&#x60;&#39;, to insert a half second pause. For example, if you connected to a company phone number and wanted to pause for one second, and then dial extension 1234 followed by the pound key, the value of this parameter would be &#x60;ww1234#&#x60;. Remember to URL-encode this string, since the &#39;&#x60;#&#x60;&#39; character has special meaning in a URL. If both &#x60;SendDigits&#x60; and &#x60;MachineDetection&#x60; parameters are provided, then &#x60;MachineDetection&#x60; will be ignored.

  # @option opts [String] :status_callback The URL we should call using the &#x60;status_callback_method&#x60; to send status information to your application. If no &#x60;status_callback_event&#x60; is specified, we will send the &#x60;completed&#x60; status. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored. URLs must contain a valid hostname (underscores are not permitted).
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :status_callback_event The call progress events that we will send to the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;initiated&#x60;, &#x60;ringing&#x60;, &#x60;answered&#x60;, and &#x60;completed&#x60;. If no event is specified, we send the &#x60;completed&#x60; status. If you want to receive multiple events, specify each one in a separate &#x60;status_callback_event&#x60; parameter. See the code sample for [monitoring call progress](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/call-resource?code-sample&#x3D;code-create-a-call-resource-and-specify-a-statuscallbackevent&amp;code-sdk-version&#x3D;json). If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; is present, this parameter is ignored.
  # @option opts [String] :status_callback_method The HTTP method we should use when calling the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;GET&#x60; or &#x60;POST&#x60; and the default is &#x60;POST&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
  # @option opts [Int32] :time_limit The maximum duration of the call in seconds. Constraints depend on account and configuration.
  # @option opts [Int32] :timeout The integer number of seconds that we should allow the phone to ring before assuming there is no answer. The default is &#x60;60&#x60; seconds and the maximum is &#x60;600&#x60; seconds. For some call flows, we will add a 5-second buffer to the timeout value you provide. For this reason, a timeout value of 10 seconds could result in an actual timeout closer to 15 seconds. You can set this to a short time, such as &#x60;15&#x60; seconds, to hang up before reaching an answering machine or voicemail.
  # @option opts [String] :trim Whether to trim any leading and trailing silence from the recording. Can be: &#x60;trim-silence&#x60; or &#x60;do-not-trim&#x60; and the default is &#x60;trim-silence&#x60;.

  # @option opts [String] :url The absolute URL that returns the TwiML instructions for the call. We will call this URL using the &#x60;method&#x60; when the call connects.

If you are using &#x60;messaging_service_sid&#x60;, this parameter must be empty.
  # @option opts [Float64] :max_price The maximum total price in US dollars that you will pay for the message to be delivered. Can be a decimal value that has up to 4 decimal places. All messages are queued for delivery and the message cost is checked before the message is sent. If the cost exceeds &#x60;max_price&#x60;, the message will fail and a status of &#x60;Failed&#x60; is sent to the status callback. If &#x60;MaxPrice&#x60; is not set, the message cost is not checked.

The media can be of type &#x60;gif&#x60;, &#x60;png&#x60;, and &#x60;jpeg&#x60; and will be formatted correctly on the recipient&#39;s device. The media size limit is 5MB for supported file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF) and 500KB for [other types](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/accepted-mime-types) of accepted media. To send more than one image in the message body, provide multiple &#x60;media_url&#x60; parameters in the POST request. You can include up to 10 &#x60;media_url&#x60; parameters per message. You can send images in an SMS message in only the US and Canada.

Set this parameter to use the [Messaging Service Settings and Copilot Features](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/services) you have configured and leave the &#x60;from&#x60; parameter empty. When only this parameter is set, Twilio will use your enabled Copilot Features to select the &#x60;from&#x60; phone number for delivery.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :persistent_action Rich actions for Channels Messages.
  # @option opts [Bool] :provide_feedback Whether to confirm delivery of the message. Set this value to &#x60;true&#x60; if you are sending messages that have a trackable user action and you intend to confirm delivery of the message using the [Message Feedback API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-feedback-resource). This parameter is &#x60;false&#x60; by default.
  # @option opts [String] :schedule_type Indicates your intent to schedule a message. Pass the value &#x60;fixed&#x60; to schedule a message at a fixed time.
  # @option opts [Bool] :send_as_mms If set to True, Twilio will deliver the message as a single MMS message, regardless of the presence of media.
  # @option opts [Time] :send_at The time that Twilio will send the message. Must be in ISO 8601 format.

  # @option opts [String] :status_callback The URL we should call using the &#x60;status_callback_method&#x60; to send status information to your application. If specified, we POST these message status changes to the URL: &#x60;queued&#x60;, &#x60;failed&#x60;, &#x60;sent&#x60;, &#x60;delivered&#x60;, or &#x60;undelivered&#x60;. Twilio will POST its [standard request parameters](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/twiml#request-parameters) as well as some additional parameters including &#x60;MessageSid&#x60;, &#x60;MessageStatus&#x60;, and &#x60;ErrorCode&#x60;. If you include this parameter with the &#x60;messaging_service_sid&#x60;, we use this URL instead of the Status Callback URL of the [Messaging Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/services/api). URLs must contain a valid hostname and underscores are not allowed.
  # @option opts [Int32] :validity_period How long in seconds the message can remain in our outgoing message queue. After this period elapses, the message fails and we call your status callback. Can be between 1 and the default value of 14,400 seconds. After a message has been accepted by a carrier, however, we cannot guarantee that the message will not be queued after this period. We recommend that this value be at least 5 seconds.
