  # unit tests for create_call
  # Create a new outgoing call to phones, SIP-enabled endpoints or Twilio Client connections
  # @param account_sid The SID of the [Account](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api/account) that will create the resource.
  # @param from The phone number or client identifier to use as the caller id. If using a phone number, it must be a Twilio number or a Verified [outgoing caller id](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/outgoing-caller-ids) for your account. If the &#x60;to&#x60; parameter is a phone number, &#x60;From&#x60; must also be a phone number.
  # @param to The phone number, SIP address, or client identifier to call.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :application_sid The SID of the Application resource that will handle the call, if the call will be handled by an application.
  # @option opts [String] :async_amd Select whether to perform answering machine detection in the background. Default, blocks the execution of the call until Answering Machine Detection is completed. Can be: &#x60;true&#x60; or &#x60;false&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :async_amd_status_callback The URL that we should call using the &#x60;async_amd_status_callback_method&#x60; to notify customer application whether the call was answered by human, machine or fax.
  # @option opts [HttpMethod] :async_amd_status_callback_method
  # @option opts [String] :byoc The SID of a BYOC (Bring Your Own Carrier) trunk to route this call with. Note that &#x60;byoc&#x60; is only meaningful when &#x60;to&#x60; is a phone number; it will otherwise be ignored. (Beta)
  # @option opts [String] :call_reason The Reason for the outgoing call. Use it to specify the purpose of the call that is presented on the called party&#39;s phone. (Branded Calls Beta)
  # @option opts [String] :call_token A token string needed to invoke a forwarded call. A call_token is generated when an incoming call is received on a Twilio number. Pass an incoming call&#39;s call_token value to a forwarded call via the call_token parameter when creating a new call. A forwarded call should bear the same CallerID of the original incoming call.
  # @option opts [String] :caller_id The phone number, SIP address, or Client identifier that made this call. Phone numbers are in [E.164 format](https://wwnw.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) (e.g., +16175551212). SIP addresses are formatted as &#x60;name@company.com&#x60;.
  # @option opts [HttpMethod] :fallback_method
  # @option opts [String] :fallback_url The URL that we call using the &#x60;fallback_method&#x60; if an error occurs when requesting or executing the TwiML at &#x60;url&#x60;. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored.
  # @option opts [String] :machine_detection Whether to detect if a human, answering machine, or fax has picked up the call. Can be: &#x60;Enable&#x60; or &#x60;DetectMessageEnd&#x60;. Use &#x60;Enable&#x60; if you would like us to return &#x60;AnsweredBy&#x60; as soon as the called party is identified. Use &#x60;DetectMessageEnd&#x60;, if you would like to leave a message on an answering machine. If &#x60;send_digits&#x60; is provided, this parameter is ignored. For more information, see [Answering Machine Detection](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/answering-machine-detection).
  # @option opts [Int32] :machine_detection_silence_timeout The number of milliseconds of initial silence after which an &#x60;unknown&#x60; AnsweredBy result will be returned. Possible Values: 2000-10000. Default: 5000.
  # @option opts [Int32] :machine_detection_speech_end_threshold The number of milliseconds of silence after speech activity at which point the speech activity is considered complete. Possible Values: 500-5000. Default: 1200.
  # @option opts [Int32] :machine_detection_speech_threshold The number of milliseconds that is used as the measuring stick for the length of the speech activity, where durations lower than this value will be interpreted as a human and longer than this value as a machine. Possible Values: 1000-6000. Default: 2400.
  # @option opts [Int32] :machine_detection_timeout The number of seconds that we should attempt to detect an answering machine before timing out and sending a voice request with &#x60;AnsweredBy&#x60; of &#x60;unknown&#x60;. The default timeout is 30 seconds.
  # @option opts [HttpMethod] :method
  # @option opts [Bool] :record Whether to record the call. Can be &#x60;true&#x60; to record the phone call, or &#x60;false&#x60; to not. The default is &#x60;false&#x60;. The &#x60;recording_url&#x60; is sent to the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL.
  # @option opts [String] :recording_channels The number of channels in the final recording. Can be: &#x60;mono&#x60; or &#x60;dual&#x60;. The default is &#x60;mono&#x60;. &#x60;mono&#x60; records both legs of the call in a single channel of the recording file. &#x60;dual&#x60; records each leg to a separate channel of the recording file. The first channel of a dual-channel recording contains the parent call and the second channel contains the child call.
  # @option opts [String] :recording_status_callback The URL that we call when the recording is available to be accessed.
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :recording_status_callback_event The recording status events that will trigger calls to the URL specified in &#x60;recording_status_callback&#x60;. Can be: &#x60;in-progress&#x60;, &#x60;completed&#x60; and &#x60;absent&#x60;. Defaults to &#x60;completed&#x60;. Separate  multiple values with a space.
  # @option opts [HttpMethod] :recording_status_callback_method
  # @option opts [String] :recording_track The audio track to record for the call. Can be: &#x60;inbound&#x60;, &#x60;outbound&#x60; or &#x60;both&#x60;. The default is &#x60;both&#x60;. &#x60;inbound&#x60; records the audio that is received by Twilio. &#x60;outbound&#x60; records the audio that is generated from Twilio. &#x60;both&#x60; records the audio that is received and generated by Twilio.
  # @option opts [String] :send_digits A string of keys to dial after connecting to the number, maximum of 32 digits. Valid digits in the string include: any digit (&#x60;0&#x60;-&#x60;9&#x60;), &#39;&#x60;#&#x60;&#39;, &#39;&#x60;*&#x60;&#39; and &#39;&#x60;w&#x60;&#39;, to insert a half second pause. For example, if you connected to a company phone number and wanted to pause for one second, and then dial extension 1234 followed by the pound key, the value of this parameter would be &#x60;ww1234#&#x60;. Remember to URL-encode this string, since the &#39;&#x60;#&#x60;&#39; character has special meaning in a URL. If both &#x60;SendDigits&#x60; and &#x60;MachineDetection&#x60; parameters are provided, then &#x60;MachineDetection&#x60; will be ignored.
  # @option opts [String] :sip_auth_password The password required to authenticate the user account specified in &#x60;sip_auth_username&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :sip_auth_username The username used to authenticate the caller making a SIP call.
  # @option opts [String] :status_callback The URL we should call using the &#x60;status_callback_method&#x60; to send status information to your application. If no &#x60;status_callback_event&#x60; is specified, we will send the &#x60;completed&#x60; status. If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; parameter is present, this parameter is ignored. URLs must contain a valid hostname (underscores are not permitted).
  # @option opts [Array(String)] :status_callback_event The call progress events that we will send to the &#x60;status_callback&#x60; URL. Can be: &#x60;initiated&#x60;, &#x60;ringing&#x60;, &#x60;answered&#x60;, and &#x60;completed&#x60;. If no event is specified, we send the &#x60;completed&#x60; status. If you want to receive multiple events, specify each one in a separate &#x60;status_callback_event&#x60; parameter. See the code sample for [monitoring call progress](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/call-resource?code-sample&#x3D;code-create-a-call-resource-and-specify-a-statuscallbackevent&amp;code-sdk-version&#x3D;json). If an &#x60;application_sid&#x60; is present, this parameter is ignored.
  # @option opts [HttpMethod] :status_callback_method
  # @option opts [Int32] :time_limit The maximum duration of the call in seconds. Constraints depend on account and configuration.
  # @option opts [Int32] :timeout The integer number of seconds that we should allow the phone to ring before assuming there is no answer. The default is &#x60;60&#x60; seconds and the maximum is &#x60;600&#x60; seconds. For some call flows, we will add a 5-second buffer to the timeout value you provide. For this reason, a timeout value of 10 seconds could result in an actual timeout closer to 15 seconds. You can set this to a short time, such as &#x60;15&#x60; seconds, to hang up before reaching an answering machine or voicemail.
  # @option opts [String] :trim Whether to trim any leading and trailing silence from the recording. Can be: &#x60;trim-silence&#x60; or &#x60;do-not-trim&#x60; and the default is &#x60;trim-silence&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :twiml TwiML instructions for the call Twilio will use without fetching Twiml from url parameter. If both &#x60;twiml&#x60; and &#x60;url&#x60; are provided then &#x60;twiml&#x60; parameter will be ignored. Max 4000 characters.
  # @option opts [String] :url The absolute URL that returns the TwiML instructions for the call. We will call this URL using the &#x60;method&#x60; when the call connects. For more information, see the [Url Parameter](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls#specify-a-url-parameter) section in [Making Calls](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/make-calls).
